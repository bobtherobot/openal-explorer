An interactive reference for OpenAL developers that provides a basis for understanding:

- Listener Orientation
- Source Direction
- Cone angles
- Distance models
- Doppler Effect
- Orientation and Direction Vectors

The simple interface provides a "top-down" view in 2D space, and allows users to move and "point" the source and listener within the work-space.

3D vectors are printed on-screen allowing developers in both the 3D and 2D realm to get a grip on the OpenAL space.

For 2D developers, this tool provides a basis for understanding volume and classic pan and how volume and panning are related to distance, direction, orientation and the distance model.

OpenAL is a cross-platform 3D audio API appropriate for use with gaming applications and many other types of audio applications, which is owned and maintained by Creative Labs.
